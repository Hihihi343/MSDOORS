# Byfron Info
**`Byfron is now released.`** and is rolling out for everyone now.<br>
If you are detected with Byfron, it’s a HWID (Hardware ID) ban, meaning that device is fucked. Unless you simply spoof your HWID :)<br>
If you want to use an FPS Unlocker use the [axstin's FPS Unlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker/releases). It now works without any risk on the 64 bit version too. Read more about the update in the changelogs.<br>
<br>
Here is how you can check if you have Byfron:
## Method 1 [Not always accurate]:
1. Open this [link](https://clientsettings.roblox.com/v2/user-channel?binaryType=WindowsPlayer).
2. If you see **`{"channelName":"LIVE"}`** you **shouldn't have**  Byfron. If you see any other channel for example `zwinplayer64` you **have** Byfron.

## Method 2 [Accurate]:
1. Join any Roblox game.
2. Open up Task Manager. `CTRL+ALT+DEL, then click "Task Manager" or search "Task Manager" in the search bar`.
3. If you see **`Roblox Game Client (32 bit)`** you **don't have** Byfron. If you see **`Roblox Game Client`** or **`Roblox Game Client (64 bit)`** you **have** Byfron.

## Method 3 [Accurate]:
1. Search **`Roblox Player`** in the search bar then right-click on it and click **`Open File Location`**. It brought you to a folder.
2. Now you should see **`Roblox Player`** file in the folder. Right-click on it and click **`Open File Location`** again.
3. Now you are again brought to a folder.
4. If you don't see a file called **`robloxplayerbeta.dll`** you **don't have** Byfron. If you see a file called that you **have** Byfron.

If you want to be fully sure check Byfron with [Method 2](https://github.com/mstudio45/MSDOORS/blob/main/README.md#method-2-accurate) and [Method 3](https://github.com/mstudio45/MSDOORS/blob/main/README.md#method-3-100-accurate-with-method-2).<br>
