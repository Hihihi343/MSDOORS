# Byfron Info
**`Byfron is now released on the global channel.`**<br>

**`The 32-bit is disabled, all bypasses are patched.`** [Remove the bypass script from Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey](https://streamable.com/ap67ik).
 The global version will download so ***`⚠️ DO NOT EXPLOIT ⚠️`***<br>

If you are detected with Byfron, it’s a HWID (Hardware ID) ban, meaning that device is fcked.<br>

If you want to use an FPS Unlocker use the [axstin's FPS Unlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker/releases). Use the Flag File method to be safe. Read more about the update in the changelogs.<br>
