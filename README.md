# Byfron Info
*If you are on mobile you are safe because currently there is no anti-cheat in the Roblox mobile app.*<br>

Byfron got released yesterday and is rolling out for everyone now.<br>
If you are detected with Byfron, it’s a HWID (Hardware ID) ban, meaning that device is fucked. Unless you simply spoof your HWID :)<br>
If you want to use an FPS Unlocker use the [axstin's FPS Unlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker/releases). It now works without any risk on the 64 bit version too. Read more about the update in the changelogs.<br>
<br>
Here is how you can check if you have Byfron:
## Method 1 [Not always accurate]:
1. Open this [link](https://clientsettings.roblox.com/v2/user-channel?binaryType=WindowsPlayer).
2. If you see **`{"channelName":"LIVE"}`** you **shouldn't have**  Byfron. If you see any other channel for example `zwinplayer64` you **have** Byfron.

## Method 2 [Accurate]:
1. Join any Roblox game.
2. Open up Task Manager. `CTRL+ALT+DEL, then click "Task Manager" or search "Task Manager" in the search bar`.
3. If you see **`Roblox Game Client (32 bit)`** you **don't have** Byfron. If you see **`Roblox Game Client`** or **`Roblox Game Client (64 bit)`** you **have** Byfron.

## Method 3 [Accurate]:
1. Search **`Roblox Player`** in the search bar then right-click on it and click **`Open File Location`**. It brought you to a folder.
2. Now you should see **`Roblox Player`** file in the folder. Right-click on it and click **`Open File Location`** again.
3. Now you are again brought to a folder.
4. If you don't see a file called **`RobloxPlayerBeta.dll`** or **`RobloxPlayerBeta`** you **don't have** Byfron. If you see a file called that you **have** Byfron.

If you want to be fully sure check Byfron with [Method 2](https://github.com/mstudio45/MSDOORS/blob/main/README.md#method-2-accurate) and [Method 3](https://github.com/mstudio45/MSDOORS/blob/main/README.md#method-3-100-accurate-with-method-2).<br>

# How to bypass Byfron:
## Method 1:
1. Close all roblox tabs opened in your browser (if you have any open).
2. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension.
3. After you have successfully installed Tampermonkey open this [link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/956649076852654122/1089031453595148338/fix_channel_roblox.user.js).
4. Find a **`Install`** button. Click that button and the script will install automaticly.
5. Go to roblox.com and click any game (it doesn't matter). Now join the game and Roblox should update.
6. To be sure if this bypass worked use the Byfron check [Method 2](https://github.com/mstudio45/MSDOORS/blob/main/README.md#method-2-accurate) or [Method 3](https://github.com/mstudio45/MSDOORS/blob/main/README.md#method-3-100-accurate-with-method-2) to check if Byfron was successfully bypassed!

## Method 2:
1. Install [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/releases) and open it.
2. Turn off **`ReShade`** in the **`Integrations`** tab.
3. Go to **`Installation`** tab.
4. Select **`LIVE`** channel.
5. Click **`Install`**.
6. To be sure if this bypass worked use the Byfron check [Method 2](https://github.com/mstudio45/MSDOORS/blob/main/README.md#method-2-accurate) or [Method 3](https://github.com/mstudio45/MSDOORS/blob/main/README.md#method-3-100-accurate-with-method-2) to check if Byfron was successfully bypassed!
